      <li>
        Codepen! My username is AlexanderAlfonso, I think?
    </p>
    </ol>
    <h2>How about we get some favorite things out of the way? </h2>
      <p>
     I love games! Some specific ones are:
        Pokemon Unite, Pokemon GO, Dead Cells, The Battle Cats, and Cookie Run!
    </p>
    <p>
Sometimes, I like to try different games. I also love anime! Demon Slayer is one of my favorites, followed by Pok√®mon, if that even counts. It's more like a cartoon. Journeys and Master Journeys are cool. Watch em!
  </p>
  
  <h3>Some important things to note:</h3>
  <p>
I get frustrated very easily at times, whether it be coding or real life issues. I also slack off at times, but I catch up sooner or later. I also loove memes. Funny stuff.
